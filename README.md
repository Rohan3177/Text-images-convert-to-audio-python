# Image to Text to Audio Converter in Java using OpenCV and Tesseract

This project aims to convert text from images to text and also audio using Java along with OpenCV and Tesseract libraries. It provides a simple solution for extracting text from images and then converting it into audio, facilitating accessibility for visually impaired individuals or situations where reading from images is necessary.

## Features

- Image Processing: Utilizes OpenCV for image processing tasks such as text detection and extraction.
- Text Recognition: Employs Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for recognizing text from images.
- Text to Audio: Converts the extracted text into audio using Java's audio processing capabilities.
- Configurability: Provides options for configuring OCR parameters and audio output settings.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- OpenCV library for Java
- Tesseract library for Java
- Maven (for managing dependencies, optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Install OpenCV: Follow the installation instructions for OpenCV in Java from google
2. Install Tesseract: Install Tesseract OCR and its Java wrapper as per the instructions provided in [Tesseract documentation](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
